# Autonomous Train Prototype – Track Design & Layout

A scaled-down autonomous train track designed for Norfolk Southern as part of Penn State’s Engineering Design course.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Create a reliable, modular track layout for a miniature autonomous train system  
- **Team Size:** 4 students  
- **Role:** Lead track designer and layout engineer  

## Features
- **Optimized Geometry:** Modeled curved and straight rail segments in SolidWorks for smooth transitions  
- **Modular Sections:** Designed interlocking track pieces for easy assembly and reconfiguration  
- **Support Structure:** Integrated baseplate and risers to maintain track level and alignment  
- **Material Selection:** Chose PLA 3D-printed rails with embedded steel strips for conductivity and durability  

## Tools & Technologies
- SolidWorks (Track segment modeling & assemblies)  
- 3D printing (PLA rails and support components)  
- MATLAB (Scripts for calculating curve radii and transition lengths, optional)
